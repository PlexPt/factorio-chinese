[mod-setting-name]
##ret-enable-connect-particles=Enable connection particles
##ret-enable-failure-text=Enable connection failure text
##ret-enable-modular-info=Enable module info text
##ret-enable-zigzag-wire=Enable zigzag wire
##ret-enable-zigzag-vertical-only=Zigzag only on vertical rails
##ret-remove-wires-on-build=Remove other wires when building
##ret-enable-circuit-wire=Enable automatic circuit wires

##ret-max-pole-search-distance=Maximum additional search distance
##ret-ticks-per-update=Ticks between updates


[mod-setting-description]
##ret-enable-connect-particles=If enabled, red and green particles will show if rails become powered or unpowered.
##ret-enable-failure-text=If enabled, a message text will pop up if two overhead line poles could not be connected.
ret-enable-modular-info=如果启用，每当模块化机车的模块配置发生更改时，都会弹出一条消息文本。
##ret-enable-zigzag-wire=If enabled, the wire will be moved left and right on straight rails to mimic the zigzag pattern that overhead lines in real life use. This has no ingame effect other than aesthetics. Does not affect existing wires.
##ret-enable-zigzag-vertical-only=Only enable the zigzag wire for vertical rails. This is useful, as the wires in Factorio normally "hang" a bit, which makes zigzag lines on horizontal or diagonal rails useless. Does not affect existing wires.
ret-remove-wires-on-build=如果启用，架空杆在放置时将仅连接到其他架空杆，而不连接到其他实体。要将它们连接到其他电线杆，需要在之后放置这些电线杆。
##ret-enable-circuit-wire=If enabled, red and green circuit wires are automatically installed between adjacent poles. Can be used to compensate for the fact that blueprinted circuit wires are unfortunately not retained. Does not affect existing poles.
##ret-enable-rewire-neighbours=If enabled, neighbours of newly placed poles will be rewired. This fixes some weird wiring patterns, but takes more processing time. Does not affect existing poles.
##ret-max-pole-search-distance=The additional distance checked when searching for overhead line poles. A higher value gives more accurate distances in the failure message. A lower value might increase performance during building.
##ret-ticks-per-update=Defines how many ticks need to pass until the next train update is run. Higher values obviously improve performance, while lower values ensure that the trains are powered more consistently. The default is 60 Ticks (1 second).
