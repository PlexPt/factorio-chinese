##moresciencepack-removeVanillaPacks=Remove Vanilla packs from researches requiring MSP1


[mod-setting-description]
##moresciencepack-TechTreeScanningPermutations=Due to the data-ordering method LUA uses for technology, more permutations are required for complex tech trees. If some technology isn't getting the packs added to them that they should (based on those required by the research's prerequisites) a higher number may be required. In testing 2-5 is usually sufficient for most mod-pack-selections.

##moresciencepack-removeVanillaPacks=Removes Vanilla packs from researches if MSP-pack-1 is required by that research. Does not remove space science pack. Limited to technologies that have MSP-1 added to them.. Incompatible (currently) with config settings that specifically disable, rename, or remove MSP-1 from research requirements). 

##moresciencepack-Dynamic-stacksize=Sets stacksizes for packs based on output (IF stacksize is less than max yield). New feature. Untested. May require corrections / simplification. Report issues if found. 
##moresciencepack-Omni-Ignored=MSP Ignores the presence (inclusion) of omniLib and acts as if it isn't enabled. MSP uses only legacy recipes and will not generate any efficiency research, or added awesomeness that was added with the inclusion of omni. It basically acts as it did before all the changes introduced with omni's inclusion. No dynamic recipes, no efficiency research, difficulty mode is ignored, all other configs related to omni are ignored.
##moresciencepack-difficulty=Difficulty affects cost of research, and reduces starting and maximum yields for the harder difficulties. 
##moresciencepack-levels-MSP=If OmniLib is enabled, global results multiplier is ignored and this value is used instead. Technologies and recipes are generated dynamically and will auto-update all entities as research is completed. Each research level for each pack provides an additional yield equal to that pack's configured result value below (except for packs that would exceed MSP-OMNI maximum-yield, in which case, yield improvement is capped). Default: 10.
##moresciencepack-legacyMode=Ignored if omniLib is disabled. If OmniLib is enabled, this re-inserts the original recipe for each pack type into the technologies that enable their efficiency research. These basic recipes do not meet the format being searched-for when omniLib auto-updates all entities after research completes, thus, to benefit from efficiency, if these early recipes are enabled alongside OmniLib, assembly machines must have their recipes updated to the first level  of efficiency before they begin auto-updating as efficiency levels improve. Default: False.
##moresciencepack-omni-maximum=If OmniLib is enabled, efficiency techs improve yield for science-crafting. This sets a max yield amount and staggers improvement/per-research-level to fit within this set boundary (designed as a limit to Module Science and Atomic Bomb science yields). Default: 400.

##moresciencepack-debugLogging=Print information to the log file stating which science packs this mod attempts to add to technologies. Error messages resulting in technologies not existing will print to the log file regardless of what is selected, most-helpful for mod-integration programming by the authors. (Default: False)

##moresciencepack-reset-ingredient-recipe-unlocks=Reset the location of MSP pack ingredient recipe_unlocks to the vanilla setting. For some items, this will mean the item can be crafted from the start of the game. for others, it will mean reversing the change another mod made to the game progression. This can resolve certain game progression issues, or may cause them, but this function can be toggled on and off. 

##moresciencepack-ErrorOnFail=Force the game to quit if MSP detects situations that may prevent game completion, such as: impossible science progression, incomplete technology tree parsing, or inability to add correct science packs to vanilla or modded technology. Backup your modsettings.dat file before enabling! (Default: False)

##moresciencepack-IntegrationEngine=Mod integration function written by usafphoenix. Adds science packs to non-blacklisted modded technologies. This should not result in a game that is impossible to research any specific technologies, but under very specific conditions this may occur. If it does, you can either add the technology to the blacklist (and this mod will no longer add science packs to the ingredient list, or submit a bug report listing what technologies are impossible. please provide modlist and modsettings info and screenshots that show why the technology can't be completed..)

##moresciencepack-EconomicsIntegration=Allow Purchase of Packs using AllAboutMoneyMod. Recipes are less efficient than crafting the packs using their primary recipe, but in a difficult situation, sometimes the cost can be worth it. Included as a secondary method for dealing with mod incompatibilities or game progression issues.

##moresciencepack-GameProgressionFix=Will remove All MSP packs from technology costs. For scenarios where game progression is impossible due to mod-conflict, and a player is unsure which packs to disable, or just wishes to complete a few technologies without MSP pack requirements. This will not alter recipes or items, but simply prevent MSP packs from being required in labs to complete research. Enable this temporarily to quickly resolve cyclic-dependency issues that prevent game progression, or permanently if you wish to play a (slightly-easier) game with Momo +(30)Science Mod. If you wish to disable a specific pack, however, set the output ("result") of that pack to "0" below.

##moresciencepack-unlock-all-packs=Begin the game with the recipes for all 30 MSP science packs enabled without requiring any research to make the packs. This does not extend to the ingredients required to craft the packs, so they won't be able to be crafted until you obtain the necessary ingredients, but this is another method for resolving cyclic-dependency conflicts caused by other mods. Options are nice.

##moresciencepack-no-lab-slots=Use with "Remove packs from research cost (Game Progression Fix)" as well as MomoTweaks mod to treat MSP's 30 Packs as Intermediate crafting ingredients for vanilla packs only. Removes slots from labs, and slightly simplifies logistic headache....at a cost of even more complex crafting. DO NOT TOGGLE THIS during a game with active labs or labs containing MSP packs. 

##moresciencepack-IncreasedModuleCost=Adds MSP packs to the cost of module research (not yet implemented)
##moresciencepack-multiplier=Multiply result_count for ALL MSP packs by this value (1-100). Ignored if omniLib is enabled.

##moresciencepack-IncreasedModuleScienceCost=Change which modules (or how many) are required for MSP pack 18, Module Science. You may wish to increase result_count as well when playing with a very costly recipe variation. Note: if bob's modules aren't enabled, or the items are interferred with by another mod, this may result in MSP 18 requiring (n)-number of tier-2 modules, instead as a backup.

##moresciencepack-ModuleScienceDifficulty=Module tier (or quantity) required for MSP 18. Minimum: 1, Default: 2, Maximum: 16. Values 1-3 are standard modules. Values 4+ will either choose modules based upon bob's modules (if enabled) or will increase the quantity of modules required per crafting operation. (values 4-8 correspond to bob's modules of same value); Tier 9-16 correspond to the raw-variety of modules the mod adds (if enabled in config). If the chosen module tier cannot be found by MSP, (or bob's modules isn't enabled at all), ingredient amounts will be increased instead (only applies for values 4+).

[gui-message]
##compat-warning-message=MSP (More Science Packs+30) has detected the presence of a mod with known compatability issues. Certain ingredients for packs may have had their associated technology changed or recipe altered by another mod, or items may have been altogether removed..or locked behind technology that is unreachable with all MSP packs enabled. It is well documented that certain science packs may be uncraftable in certain combinations of mods and settings. Or you may experience no problems at all. To combat this, individual packs can now be configured so that they are not added to any technology costs by MSP, also the location of a recipe unlock can be set back to the vanilla equivalent by MSP if desired (which can also solve some of these scenarios). These options can be toggled on and off at any time throughout your game. More information can be found in startup-settings as well as the mod homepage.
